# surfs_up
## Overview
For this analysis, we will be analyzing temperature data for the months of June and December so W. Avy can further contemplate opening a surf shop in Oahu. Now that we have queried precipitation data as well as general temperature data, we will need to narrow our queries to these two months so W. Avy can make the correct business decisions regarding his surf shop's business cycles.
## Results
Here are some of the main findings from our analysis of June and December temperatures in Oahu:
  * December temperatures are only about 3 degrees cooler on average relative to June (about 71 and 74 degrees, respectively). 
  * The standard deviation in both datasets is only about 3 degrees for both June and December.
  * The maximum temperature for December is only 2 degrees cooler than in June (83 and 85 respectively), while the minimum temperature is 8 degrees cooler in December (64 in June,   56 in December).
## Summary
These results suggest good news for W. Avy's business. December temperatures only being 3 degrees cooler on average suggest relatively stable temperatures throughout the whole year, making weather ideal for surfing throughout the whole year. This makes W. Avy's business resilient through seasonal business cycles. The standard deviation of about 3 degrees for both months further suggests this stability, given that on most days, temperatures won't stray further away than 9 degrees above or below the average (given the large amount of temperature observations, it is likely that the distribution would be normal). While the maximum and minimum temperatures may be relatively unusual to see (potentially outliers), the difference of 8 degrees in the minimum temperature for both months and only 2 degrees continues to suggest stable and apt weather for the surf shop.
### Query Recommendations
For this analysis, it might be enlightening to run a query that would look into a few other months in winter and summer, particularly for winter. While the December temperatures would be colder than in June, it might be helpful to look at other colder months, such as January and February. Comparable months for June would be May, July, and potentially August. Another query to perform would be to juxtapose precipitation data along with temperature data, while narrowing precipitation data for summer and winter months rather than the entire year.
